Team Name: HackKnights

Hackathon Name: Hacknite

Project Name: Indigrow


Overview

The web program Indigrow, which is built on Python, was created to help farmers boost their crop yields.  Indigrow gives farmers practical information including weather updates, irrigation techniques, crop and fertilizer recommendations, and yield estimates by fusing real-time data, machine learning, and intuitive user interfaces.  Our mission is to provide planting solutions that increase the productivity and efficiency of farming.

Qualities:

     1. Homepage featuring a logo:
       A friendly homepage with the Indigrow emblem.
       
     2. Dashboard that is interactive:
       Farmers are asked to provide their
          State
          The district
          Type of soil
          Present crop
      The backend analyzes the data to produce insights based on these inputs.
      
     3. Integration of Satellite Imagery:
         identifies the precise latitude and longitude of the farmer's location by retrieving satellite photos using Geopy, Selenium, and Folium.
     
     4. Weather Analysis in Real Time:
         uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information and rain probabilities.
     
     5. Reasonable Suggestions:
         The ideal crop to sow following the current crop's harvest.

         ideal techniques for irrigation.

         yield estimate based on input data.

       The best crop and soil nutrients, along with practical recommendations.

     6. Integration of Machine Learning:
        makes use of machine learning models to provide precise forecasts and suggestions.

     7. Final Objective:
        to offer planting alternatives that increase yield and give farmers more power.

 Frontend Technologies:

     PyCutify was used to create a clear and engaging user interface.

 Backend:

     backend based on Python and driven by:

         Libraries for Machine Learning:

             Sklearn, or Scikit-learn

             Pandas

             NumPy

         Satellite & Geolocation Tools:

             Geopy

             Selenium

             Folium

         Weather Information:

             The OpenWeatherMap API

 Database:

     keeps track of crop, soil, and fertilizer data for precise analysis and suggestions.

 How It Operates:

     1. Farmers go to the homepage of the website.

      Go to the dashboard and enter the following information when prompted:

         State

         The district

         Type of soil

         Present crop

     2. This data is processed by the backend:

         makes use of geolocation techniques to retrieve satellite images.

         uses the OpenWeatherMap API to analyze weather data.

      3. Using models for machine learning to compute:

             best produce for the following growing season.

             ideal watering technique for their property.

             yield estimate.

             suggested fertilizers according to crop and soil type.

      4. The results are displayed back to the farmer in an easy-to-understand format.

   Usage:

     1. Open the webpage.

     2. Fill up the dashboard form with your farming information.

     3. View customized suggestions, such as:

        weather reports.

        techniques for irrigation.

        Ideas for crops for the upcoming season.

        suggestions for fertilizer accompanied by useful information.

     4. Make use of these tips to enhance your farming methods.

Future Extent:

     1. Real-time field monitoring through integration with IoT devices.

     2. Links to buy fertilizer have been expanded for convenience.

     3. Creation of mobile applications to improve accessibility.

     4. Support in multiple languages for a worldwide audience.
